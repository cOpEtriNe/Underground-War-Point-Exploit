Script is patched

# Underground-War-Point-Exploit
This is a very basic exploit. 

## How it works.

This exploit works by using some script. Once this script has been executed, the game thinks you are digging.

Digging makes you gain points.

A faster way to do this is to buy the dig rate for 100 points in the shop.
